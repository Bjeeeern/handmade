# handmade

This repository roughly contains the game code and [my other repository](https://github.com/Bjeeeern/platform) 
contains the game engine. The repository is named after the quite amazing [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) web series
which I am working my way through as I slowly learn to do this stuff.

I have followed along until episode 59 on and off  and I am now currently adding a car, 
trying to take the game in a more original direction.

I did some detouring along the way to play around with 3D cameras and font file processing. 
Also ported the platform to Android and OSX up until before implementing the audio but by now the builds have sadly rotted away.
