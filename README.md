# handmade

This repository roughly contains the game code and [my other repository](https://github.com/Bjeeeern/platform) 
contains the game engine. The repository is named after the quite amazing [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) web series
which I am working my way through as I piece by piece learn how to make this stuff.

I have followed along until episode 59 on and off and am now currently adding a car. It feels interesting taking the game in a more personal direction.

I did some detouring along the way to play around with 3D cameras and font file processing.

I also tried porting the platform to Android and OSX except for doing the audio, but it has been a while since I used the code so I will probably just rewrite it.
